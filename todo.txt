Game dynamics:
- resource-type objects (health, heat, ...)
- direction-based shooting
- momentum-preserving splits
- multi-player (mixed human/non-human controllers)

Example games:
- asteroids
- pong

Interfaces
- longer-range subjective vision
- more diverse observable feature representations

Other:
- nicer graphics, possibly based on palettes
- full score system, intermediate rewards
- visualize continuous trajectories
