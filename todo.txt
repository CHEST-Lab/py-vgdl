Game dynamics:
- resource-type objects (health, heat, ...)
- chasing NPCs
- direction-based shooting
- momentum-preserving splits
- non-square sprites
- multi-player (mixed human/non-human controllers)

Example games:
- pacman
- asteroids
- pong

Other:
- nicer graphics, possibly based on palettes
- full score system
